	<p id="tribute-info">Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer program in the eighteen hundreds.</p> <!-- User story 6 -->
		<p>According the reference page listed below, Ada was both a computer programmer and a mathematician.  Some highlights of her life include:
      <ul>
        <li>She was born and died in London, United Kingdom.</li>
        <li>She was the daughter of the famous poet Lord George Gordon Byron.</li>
        <li>When she was 17 years old, she met Charles Babbage.  Babbage is cited as the father of the computer.</li>
        <li>Babbage invented the Difference Engine.  Ada was able to look at the machine.  Later, Babbage developed plans for the Analytical Machine.  At a later date, Ada was asked to translate an article on this idea from French to English.  She included many of her own ideas, including how a code could be written for machines to handle  letters and numbers.  <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-YGe81WoL.jpg" alt="Image of book on Ada Lovelace" class="center"></li>
        <li>For her efforts, Ada did not generate much interest during her lifetime.  However, in more recent times, Ada Lovelace is considered to be the first computer programmer.</li>

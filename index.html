		<p id="tribute-info">Many people wrongly assume that computer programming was developed in the last century. In addition, many people assume that the initial code was created by a man. Women were pioneers in this field! In 1842 Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer program.</p><!-- User story 6 -->
		<p>According the reference page listed below, Ada was both a computer programmer and a mathematician. Some highlights of her life include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>She was born and died in London, United Kingdom.</li>
			<li>She was the daughter of the famous poet Lord George Gordon Byron.</li>
			<li>When she was 17 years old, she met Charles Babbage. Babbage is cited as the father of the computer.</li>
			<li>In 1821 Babbage began working on inventing the Difference Engine. <img alt="picture of the difference engine" class="center" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Babbage_Difference_Engine.jpg/320px-Babbage_Difference_Engine.jpg">Since Ada spent time with him, she was able to look at this machine and learn from Babbage's work. Later, Babbage developed plans for the Analytical Machine. Eventually Ada was asked to translate an article on this machine idea from French to English. She included many of her own ideas, including the theoretical groundwork on how a code could be written for machines to handle letters and numbers. <img alt="Image of book on Ada Lovelace" class="center" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-YGe81WoL.jpg"></li>
			<li>For her efforts, Ada did not generate much interest during her lifetime. However, in more recent times, Ada Lovelace is considered to be the first computer programmer.</li>
